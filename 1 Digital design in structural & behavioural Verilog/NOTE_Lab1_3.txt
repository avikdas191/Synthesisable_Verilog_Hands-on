//=========== amendments for the Lab_1_3 ========================

// all_your_HDL_code BEGIN

	// keep the wire declarations for wire_1 and wire_2
	
	// replace each line of structural code (describing a gate) 
	// with a line of behavioural code (driving a wire or output port)
	
	// two lines for driving wire_1 and wire_2 (DO NOT FORGET USING reduction operators !)

	// three lines to drive output ports HEX0[3], HEX3[0], HEX5[7]
